<p>GPG Keys OpenGP standards define the semantics for secure information exchange. GPG is the software that follows OpenPG standards. GPG is an acronym for GNU Privacy Guard. Alice and Bob are the foo-bar, the spam-eggs of the world of computer security. Symmetric key cryptography takes place by two different methods. The first in which there are two keys, both same, and the second in which both keys are different. GPG helps in symmetric key cryptography. Assuming Alice and Bob to be two people who want to communicate and send messages to each other. Both will possess their own private and...</p>

<p>“I love reading Jeffery Archer.” It is possible to guess which of your friends said it. The computer can also guess who! In a group of people, who is more likely to have said something can be predicted if the computer has heard them talk before. The computer can analyze their thought process while interacting with them and, in due course of time, predict the most probable speaker, given a statement. Introduction ‘Who Said It?’ aims at mirroring the analytical power of the human brain. Just as the human brain can process a given amount of data to deduce something,...</p>

<p>These are my beginner steps in robotics. I have always been fascinated by robotics, and given my interest in artificial intelligence, this area has always been a region of wanderlust for me. However, my interest in robotics was limited to being dazed by the advancements in its field, reading about various types of bots and shaking hands with them. I have never built one, but now, after attending classes in the Global Virtual Lecture Hall of ShanghAI, I definately am capable enough to give it a try. ShanghAI has helped me to delve deeper into exactly how they work, it...</p>

<p>Spider or Ant According to the philosophies of computer science a spider is the same as a ant. Yes! that, in fact is true because this almost jargon is talking about web crawling or web scuttering which is further used for automatic indexing and web scraping. I used the spider algorithm to get data from a few sites. The first hack was using lynx and Beautiful Soup and, later, a better and elegant solution using Python’s urlparse and urllib instead of lynx. Beautiful Soup is indeed beautiful, as beautiful as the morning Sun shining on the dew covered grass. Excuse...</p>

<p>Name based gender identification using NLTK This project is based on a simple idea that usually the female names end in vowels like ‘a’, ‘e’ and ‘i’, whereas male names usually end in ‘k’, ‘o’, ‘r’, ‘s’ and ‘t’. Using this feature, we can generate a confidence value if the input name belongs to a male or a female. So far, I have not found any such study on Indian names and so decided to do one. The study on English names can be found here. The English name corpus has been included in the ‘names’ package of NLTK. It...</p>
