## [whoami](http://about.me/siddha.ganju) 

I am a Master of **Computational Data Science** student at **Carnegie Mellon University**. My main research interests are Multimodal Deep Learning and Multimodal Question Answering. Broadly my work is at the intersection of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Multi-modal learning and Data Science (including Statistics).

I did my bachelors from [National Institute of Technology](http://www.nith.ac.in/), Hamirpur, India.

## Select Projects

### Visual Question Answering

Our research focuses on an unexplored theme in weak supervision for annotating large scale image datasets: utilizing visual questions asked about images. We base our work on the key observation that the question itself provides useful information about the image (even without the answer being available). For instance, the question 'what is the breed of the dog?' informs the computer that the animal in the scene is a dog and that there is only one dog present.

### [Atom Smashing using Machine Learning at CERN](http://sidgan.me/technical/hackathon/2015/08/17/Summer-Internship-CERN-I) (CERN Openlab project)
Used Apache Spark to streamline different predictive prototypes by gathering information from CMS, ran predictive models and proposed datasets which will become popular over time. Evaluated quality of individual models, performed component analysis and selected best predictive model for new set of data.

### [Automated Pipeline for Machine Learning Problems](http://sidgan.me/technical/2014/12/14/pipeline-for-ml)

Created a Python command line toolkit using scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries to solve machine learning problems automatically. Imputation and hyper parameteric optimization placed my model among the top 10% of the Titanic kaggle.com challenge (Rank 198 out of 2035 in July 2014). Experimented with large data sets and deployed on Hadoop cluster over AWS.
