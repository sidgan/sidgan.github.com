## [whoami](http://about.me/siddha.ganju) 

Currently, I am employed as a **Data Scientist** at [**Deep Vision**](http://deepvision.io/). I graduated from [**Carnegie Mellon University**](http://www.cmu.edu/) with a **Master's in Computational Data Science**. My main research interests are Multimodal Deep Learning and Multimodal Question Answering. Broadly my work is at the intersection of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Multi-modal learning Computer Vision, and Data Science (including Statistics). I want to solve problems that connect natural languages and computer vision using deep learning. I did my bachelors from [National Institute of Technology](http://www.nith.ac.in/) (NIT), Hamirpur, India.

## Speaker

**Speaker**, [Strata + Hadoop World, San Jose, 2016](http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/speaker/225765), I gave a talk about my [research](http://sidgan.me/technical/hackathon/2015/08/17/Summer-Internship-CERN-I) at [CERN](http://home.cern/), the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

## Select Projects

### Open Advancement of Question Answering Consortium

Developed Question-Answering systems based on an ensemble of Deep Learning and Rule-based systems.

Mentor: [Eric Nyberg](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/), [Matthias Grabmair](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mgrabmai/)

### What's in the Future: Generating Videos with Motion Sensitive Adversarial Networks (Course Project, Deep Learning-10807)

Used optical flow and GAN’s to generate future frames using our [FlowGAN](https://github.com/OMGitsHongyu/Frame_prediction_cGAN) architecture. Transferred the learned representations for Action Recognition and Static Image Editing.

### [Atom Smashing using Machine Learning at CERN](http://sidgan.me/technical/hackathon/2015/08/17/Summer-Internship-CERN-I) (CERN Openlab research project)
Used Apache Spark to streamline different predictive prototypes by gathering information from CMS, ran predictive models and proposed datasets which will become popular over time. Evaluated quality of individual models, performed component analysis and selected best predictive model for new set of data.

### [Automated Pipeline for Machine Learning Problems](http://sidgan.me/technical/2014/12/14/pipeline-for-ml)

Created a Python command line toolkit using scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries to solve machine learning problems automatically. Imputation and hyper parameteric optimization placed my model among the top 10% of the Titanic kaggle.com challenge (Rank 198 out of 2035 in July 2014). Experimented with large data sets and deployed on Hadoop cluster over AWS.
