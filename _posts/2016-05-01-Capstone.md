## Data

The data should be in the form of a dialogue between the user and the system, and the system should answer a question based on the context of all the previous information provided to it. Consider a use case where of different buildings, where there are restaurants serving different food items. To make things simple and create sufficient training data consider a scenario of ten buildings, each one of them having ten different restaurants and ten different dishes.

#### Buildings

BUILDING1, BUILDING2, BUILDING3, BUILDING4, BUILDING5, BUILDING6, BUILDING7, BUILDING8, BUILDING9 and BUILDING10

#### Restaurants

REST1, REST2, REST3, REST4, REST5, REST6, REST7, REST8, REST9 and REST10

#### Food Items

FOOD1, FOOD2, FOOD3, FOOD4, FOOD5, FOOD6, FOOD7, FOOD8, FOOD9 and FOOD10

### Creating the Dataset

The data set was created using different possible combinations of the above entities but only one-to-one mapping was considered between them. Also apart from the sentences having the answer noise statements were also added in the dialogue to simulate a real life scenario. The experiments are on Wh questions (i.e. Where is, What is etc.) and Yes/No questions.

### Types of Dataset

We creating the following types of datasets to carry out various experiments:

- Randomized dataset with one, two and three noise statements, single turn dialogue and a Wh question.
- Randomized dataset with one, two, three, four, five and six noise statements, two turn dialogue and Wh questions.
- Randomized dataset with one, two and three noise statements, single turn dialogue and a Y/N question.
- Randomized dataset with one, two, three, four, five and six noise statements, two turn dialogue and Y/N questions.
- Randomized dataset with one, two and three noise statements, two turn dialogue and a combination of Wh and Y/N questions.

## Experiments

Here we present a few screenshots of the final web application. This is done by running the web application on the local host server. 

__Example 1__

![](/images/capstone2.png)

The question presented is “Does it serve food1”. To completely answer this question, the memory network must:

1. Understand what “it” refers to
2. Relate the entity “food1” to another entity iteratively in different networks (denoted by Mem 1, Mem 2 and Mem 3)


The different steps entailed in calculating the final answer are as follows: 

1. Based on all the sentences present in each compartment of each memory network, first find the most recent sentence, which is present at the last time stamp. This will give the entity that is related to “it”. 
	a. The solution that the memnets find for this step is “rest8” with confidence value of 0.38 calculated by Mem 2. 
	b. For the memnet, the question now becomes “Does rest8 serve food1”?
2. Next, the memnet needs to find the truth in the question, it can either be yes or no, based on the confidence value of each. 
	a. Mem 3 finds that “rest8 serves food8” with a confidence value of 0.37. 
	b. Mem 1 finds that “rest2 serves food1” with a confidence value of 0.81. 
	c. These three statements coupled together form a transitive relation, which outputs a “no”, which is the final result that we see. 

Note that the sum of the confidence values for all the episodic memories in one memory is approximately equal to 1.  This indicates the confidence of that memory in finding the current entity relation. 

__Example 2__

![](/images/capstone1.png)

The question presented is “Which is the closest restaurant”. To completely answer this question, the memory network must:

1. Understand “which” refers to what entity
2. Relate the entity “restaurant” to another entity iteratively in different networks (denoted by Mem 1, Mem 2 and Mem 3)

Note that the memory networks knows “restaurant” is an entity based on the training data and it is able to figure out how “closest” relates to “restaurant”. The network may not know what these entities actually are in the real world. 

The different steps entailed in calculating the final answer are as follows: 

1. Based on all the sentences present in each compartment of each memory network, first find the sentence which gives the current location of the use. This will give the entity that is related to “closest”. 
	a. The solution that the memnets find for this step is “building10” with confidence value of 1.00 calculated by Mem 2. 
	b. For the memnet, the question now becomes “Which is the closest restaurant to building10”?
2. Next, the memnet needs to find the truth value or the answer for the question, it needs to be a word, like “rest10” based on the confidence value of each. As mentioned above, the relation of “Restaurant” to “Rest” is learnt from the training data. 
	a. Mem 3 finds that “building10 has rest10” with a confidence value of 0.98. 
	b. These three statements coupled together form a transitive relation, which outputs the answer “rest10”, which is the final result that we see.
