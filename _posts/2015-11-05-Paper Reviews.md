In the [paper review](http://sidgan.me/tags.html#paper%20review-ref) posts I will write about the papers that I have read. The posts are in no particular order. I am writing this in order to consolidate my thoughts and gain an insight into how neural networks work. Additionally, reading all these papers helps to the understand the basics, learn about the datasets and the various evaluation metrics that exist. 

There might be some questions that I write which I am not able to fully grasp or sometimes are just a hunch. They don't reflect on anything at all.
