## Tensor Flow 

+ Both C++ and Python
+ Released by Google

## Theano

Its a python library that allows one to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Developed at University of Montreal. 

Some important and beneficiary features of Theano are: 

+ Tight integration with NumPy
	+ Use numpy ndarray in Theano-compiled functions.
+  Hence Theano has been powered for large-scale computationally intensive investigations as it is also approachable enough to be used in the classroom. 
+ The package contains a number of utility modules that are helpful with machine learning tasks.
+ Keras, Pylearn2 are some other libraries which are build on Theano. 
+ Have a state of the art model for RNN and LSTM

## Caffe

+ Berkeley Vision and Learning Center developed it
+ Pretrained models are available for MNIST and other datasets which makes their use easy. 
+ Extremely portable 
+ Fast, Caffe is said to have the fastest implementation of CNN. 

## Gensim 

+ Python library. 
+ Implementation of Word2Vec and Doc2Vec which is widely used. 

## Deeplearning4j

+ A Java and Scala library. 
+ Mainly a business framework
+ Brings a scala-like thinking

##Torch

+ Written in Lua
+ State of the art convolutional network models 

## Cuda 
+ Support by GPU acceleration
+ CuDNN supports other frameworks and libraries
