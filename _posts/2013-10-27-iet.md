## India Scholarship Awards

We had to present a solution for Inclusive Growth using Technology at the India Scholarship Awards 2013, organised by the Institution of Engineering and Technology. In this national competition, participants had to go through four levels of competition and the performance of students was judged by innovative ideas, technically and economically viable solutions and problem solving capacity as potential leaders in future. A total of 5000 students participated. Following this I was honored to be the Women IET Ambassador as well. I also got the opportunity to represent India at the Community Volunteers Conference held by the Institution of Engineering and Technology at Sri Lanka.
