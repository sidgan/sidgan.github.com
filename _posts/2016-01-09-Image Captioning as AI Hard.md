Here, I am consolidating what an AI Hard task is and why is image captioning considered one. 

Image captioning is a AI hard task as it involves: 

+ Grounding natural language symbols to the physical world 
+ Semantically understanding content of images
+ Multi-modal knowledge from several sub-domains is required to solve AI Hard tasks
+ Well defined evaluation metric (currently it is the number of questions that are correctly answered by a VQA system.)


An image is understood when it is possible to generate a caption which encompasses the salient features in the image.
