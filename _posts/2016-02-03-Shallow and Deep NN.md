## Shallow Neural Networks

Have the summation over all the functions, hence, these have only one hidden layer. 



## Deep Neural Networks

The final value is obtained through functions inside another functions, hence, these have many hidden layers. These hidden layers may be of differnet types. 
These are more efficient for representing certian classes of fucntions. 



Deep Models are able to extract more information and hence perform better, because they have more intermediate layers to learn the functions. 

## Effect of having more layers on output performance
