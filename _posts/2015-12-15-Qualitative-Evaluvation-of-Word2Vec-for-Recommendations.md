This project uses Word2Vec for understanding why a review for a business given by a user is rated '3 stars' or '1 star'. The report is [here](https://sidgan.me/images/Qualitative_Evaluation_of_Word2Vec_for_Recommendations.pdf).

I would like to thank our mentor, Prof. William Cohen for accepting and guiding us throughout this project and my teammates, Sravya Popuri and Srikant Avarsala. Special thanks to Manaal Faruqui who helped us understand the complexities of Word2Vec.
