[This](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitio-cli) is a neat CLI package to get ones own cutom git.io domain. It is simple to use. Just do:

`gitio 'https://github.com/username_or_handle' 'custom_domain'`

So, 

`gitio ‘https://github.com/sidgan’ ‘sg’`

To check if the domain has already been taken, just go to git.io/custom_domain and see if it is available or not. So, hurry!! before someone takes the custom git.io domain that youv'e always wanted.
