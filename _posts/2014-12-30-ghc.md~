Grace Hopper Conference, Bangalore, India, 2014

---write about grace hopper and anita borg 
Grace Hopper was a computer scientist and a US Navy Admiral who is credited to several laureals in the field of computers alone that she was nicknamed 'Amazing Grace'. Amongst her computer genius, she invented the first compiler and promoted the idea of a machine independent, high-level, programming language which ultimately led to the development of COBOL. 

To celebrate Grace Hopper and her achievements, the Anita Borg Institute holds the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in partnership with ACM India. It is the India's largest gathering of Women Technologists. This year, I also got the opportunity of attending the Grace Hopper Celebration Hackathon at Bangalore.  

A womenâ€™s hackathon provides ample opportunities that allow women to escape boundaries, that, have in the past constrained their activities and their individuality. One such women's hackathon was the Grace Hopper Conference Hackathon at Bangalore, India, which was a great opportunity to meet like minded women from all around India.

It was a mecca of ignited minds where women, students and young leaders in computer science came together, explored computing and become producers of future innovations. Along with fun, it provided a safe and encouraging environment where I was able to put my thoughts together. Along with my team mates, we contributed towards solving challenges that the world faces today, with our unique perspectives'. 

Two main issues raised at the hackathon were of security and health. A general concensus stated these as the major challenges faced by Indian women. At the hackathon I was able to exchange ideas with other inspiring technosavy women. All this and being away from the hackneyed routine of college, increased my creativity and enhanced performance. I am quite sure that all the knowledge that I gained from this congregation will enable me to produce paradigm-shifting results one day.

This was my first hackathon that continued for over a month and had people simulateously commiting code from different geographical locations. Being in constant communication and up-to-date with the latest code commits was in itself a challenge. Soon after classes, every day, I would find myself peering over new email threads, modifying the code base, optimizing algorithms and deploying the existing code. 

### Kaam Hai?, Hackathon entry

Our team developed the winning hackathon entry, 'Kaam Hai?', a web based app for NGO's that connects low skilled job seekers with potential employers.
