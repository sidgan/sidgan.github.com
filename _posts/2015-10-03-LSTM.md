[Here](https://github.com/sidgan/Theano-LSTM) is the implementation of LSTM in Theano and tested on IMDB dataset 

Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks by Alex Graves is a great book. It describes LSTM's and RNN's 

LSTM's were introduced by Sepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber in their paper. They describe six experiments where LSTM's are able to perform better than RNN's compared on various basis.
