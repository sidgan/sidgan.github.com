## Grace Hopper Conference
Previously, I got the opportunity to be a part of [Grace Hopper Conference, India](http://sidgan.me/conference/hackathon/2014/11/25/ghc/) and this year I got to attend Grace Hopper Conference, Texas too! I got the chance to be motivated by Sheryl Sandberg, Susan Wojcicki, Hilary Mason, Megan Smith, Moira Forbes, CMU's very own Manuela M. Veloso and so many more inspirational women. I met and was amazed by the energy of so many more great women. 

## GHC Scholar 

I was a [Grace Hopper Scholar](http://ghc.anitaborg.org/scholars/2015-scholars/ganju-siddha-app267s1/) for 2015. Thank you Capital One for sponsorship! It's a great effort that companies like Capital One support and fund students like me. I can't thank them enough for this great opportunity. 

## Command line Pipeline for machine learning problems
My poster for [Command Line Pipeline for Machine Learning Problems](http://sidgan.me/technical/2014/12/14/pipeline-for-ml/) got accepted at this years Grace Hopper Conference. The idea for the design was inspired by a [poster](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/57104/) made by Lucy and Natalia from London School of Economics and Political Science. 

## Open Source Day Hackathon in team Cloudera
I participated in the Open Source Day Hackathon and was in Team Cloudera. We hacked on a data science problem for social good. The data was provided by a Bay Area Museum. More information about the hackathon can be found on the [ABI wiki](http://systers.org/wiki/communities/doku.php?id=wiki:ghc:ghc15:osd:cloudera). 

We used several data visualization softwares like, Tableau, Raphael, Google Charts to make interactive visualizations and gained insights from them. This was my first OSD and for GHC 2016, I will be volunteering in the OSD committee. 

## Mentoring at Github 
This was my first time being a mentor and I mentored for Github. It was great! I would love to mentor again for Github and for other organizations too. The mentees had the following two options to learn from: 

+ Hello World!
	- They will follow GitHub's Hello World guide in small groups to create their first open source project with real content and make pull requests on your and other attendees' projects. A great example of a project like is [this](https://github.com/DBNess/nyc-bucket-list).

+ Git-It
	- This was a bit more advanced, for those who are already comfortable using the command line. Git-it, a terminal app that powers the Patchwork tutorial for learning Git and GitHub. To use Git-it you'll need to have both Git and Node.js installed on your computer.

There are full setup instructions [here](https://github.com/jlord/git-it#what-youll-need-to-run-this).
