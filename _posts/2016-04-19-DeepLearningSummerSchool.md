Hi! If you are from the **Deep Learning Summer School**, please check out my CV [here](http://sidgan.me/images/SiddhaGanju-CV.pdf). 

My current projects are:

- **Image Captioning**:
	- Working towards developing captions for images using attention models, the results from MS COCO leaderboard will be shortly added. 
- **Video Question Answering**: 
    - Implementing different language models to make the question answering more dynamic. 
- **Intelligent and Proactive Dialog (Intelligent Chat Bot)**:
    - Which can carry context from one dialog exchange to another and can use this information to initiate a new dialog.
    - This is being developed using memory networks and is tested on an indigenous CMU corpus of dialogs also developed by me. 
- [**Repodoctor**](https://github.com/harunurhan/repodoctor) for the Mozilla Science Lab, to support open research. 
- [**The EESEN-Transcriber**](https://github.com/sidgan/eesen-transcriber) in which my work is:
	- To add the video indexing based on the words spoken in the video
	- To develop real time video summarization
	- To be able to write out the differences in text format between two video clusters or two videos.
    - Video Question Answering
    - This project will be added to the **SpeechKitchen.org**
