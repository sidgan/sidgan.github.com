## Select Projects

### Open Advancement of Question Answering Consortium

Developed Question-Answering systems based on an ensemble of Deep Learning and Rule-based systems.

Mentor: [Eric Nyberg](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/), [Matthias Grabmair](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mgrabmai/)

### What's in the Future: Generating Videos with Motion Sensitive Adversarial Networks (Course Project, Deep Learning-10807)

Used optical flow and GAN’s to generate future frames using our [FlowGAN](https://github.com/OMGitsHongyu/Frame_prediction_cGAN) architecture. Transferred the learned representations for Action Recognition and Static Image Editing.

Arxiv (Coming Soon!)

### Request for Research, OpenAI
[Jokes Entity Recognition (JER)](https://github.com/sidgan/Is_this_a_joke): Collected 16031 joke-urls licensed under fair use of data. Trained a character-level LSTM language model on collected data and developed JER



### [Atom Smashing using Machine Learning at CERN](http://sidgan.me/technical/hackathon/2015/08/17/Summer-Internship-CERN-I) (CERN Openlab research project)
Used Apache Spark to streamline different predictive prototypes by gathering information from CMS, ran predictive models and proposed datasets which will become popular over time. Evaluated quality of individual models, performed component analysis and selected best predictive model for new set of data.

### [Automated Pipeline for Machine Learning Problems](http://sidgan.me/technical/2014/12/14/pipeline-for-ml)

Created a Python command line toolkit using scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries to solve machine learning problems automatically. Imputation and hyper parameteric optimization placed my model among the top 10% of the Titanic kaggle.com challenge (Rank 198 out of 2035 in July 2014). Experimented with large data sets and deployed on Hadoop cluster over AWS.
