## Blog
Blog discussing my works leading from frobnications to tweaking and what I learnt from them. 

## Built 
Jekyll server, a parser engine, for creating my website. A parser engines main job is to parse files of a specific format and then generates a website. 

Documentation: [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://www.jekyllbootstrap.com) 

Previously, I have used Tumblr for blogging, however sometimes their servers overload leading to no access to the sites, so I decided to switch over to Github.
