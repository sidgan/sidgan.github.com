## About me 

I am a final year computer science student at [National Institute of Technology](http://nith.ac.in/). I am absolutely facinated by computers and decided to major in this branch. I am a voracius movie-watcher and book lover. Learning something new everyday is exciting and this is what I strive for. My main interests are in Artificial Intelegence, Machine learning and recently I started discovering Deep Learning. All these make my childhood dreams seem alive. 


## About blog 

Blog discussing my works leading from frobnications to tweaking and what I learnt from them.

Previously, I have used Tumblr for blogging, however sometimes their servers overload leading to no access to the sites, so I decided to switch over to Github.
