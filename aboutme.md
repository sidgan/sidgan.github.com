## [whoami](http://about.me/siddha.ganju) 

I am a Master's of Computational Data Science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I love learning new things every day. I strive to gain in-depth knowledge about the existing knowledge breadth I possess. Its a great motivator! My main interests are Data Science including Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and Statistics. Recently I started discovering Deep Learning and the amazing world of RNN's and LSTM's. Learning something unique everyday is exciting and this is what encourages me.

I did my bachelors from [National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India](http://www.nith.ac.in/). I am absolutely fascinated by computers and decided to major in this engineering branch.

I am a avid movie-watcher and book lover. I am also a Quoran. It has boosted my knowledge tremendously and greatly enhanced my appreciation for life. I like to travel too.
