## [whoami](http://about.me/siddha.ganju) 

I am a Master's of Computational Data Science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I abide by the motto, "my heart is in the work" because we learn new things every day. I strive to gain in-depth knowledge about the existing knowledge breadth we possess. Its a great motivator! My main interests are Data Science including Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and statistics. Recently I started discovering Deep Learning. Working on projects related to these make my childhood dreams seem alive. Learning something unique everyday is exciting and this is what encourages me. 

I did my bachelors from [National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur](http://nith.ac.in/), India. I am absolutely fascinated by computers and decided to major in this engineering branch. 

I am a avid movie-watcher and book lover. I am also a [Quoran](http://www.quora.com/). It has boosted my knowledge tremendously and greatly enhanced my appreciation for life. I like to travel too. 


## About blog 

Blog discussing my works leading from frobnications to tweaking and what I learnt from them.

Previously, I have used [Tumblr](http://sidgan.tumblr.com/) for blogging, however sometimes their servers overload leading to no access to the sites, so I decided to switch over to Github.
