## [whoami](http://about.me/siddha.ganju) 

I am a final year computer science student at [National Institute of Technology](http://nith.ac.in/), India. I am absolutely fascinated by computers and decided to major in this engineering branch. My main interests are in Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and recently I started discovering Deep Learning. Working on projects related to these make my childhood dreams seem alive. Learning something new everyday is exciting and this is what I strive for. 

I am a avid movie-watcher and book lover. I am also a [Quoran](http://www.quora.com/). It has boosted my knowledge tremendously and greatly enhanced my appreciation for life. I like to travel too. 


## About blog 

Blog discussing my works leading from frobnications to tweaking and what I learnt from them.

Previously, I have used [Tumblr](http://sidgan.tumblr.com/) for blogging, however sometimes their servers overload leading to no access to the sites, so I decided to switch over to Github.
